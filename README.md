# CNN-for-face-anti-spoofing

## Description
This is my graduation project and it is based on " Deep Learning for Face Anti-Spoofing: An End-to-End Approach" published by Yasar Abbas Ur Rehamn, Lai Man Po and Mengyang Liu. Please check [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8166863).    

I built three CNN models Model A,B,C based on VGG-11. And it ultimately realized accuracies of 93.74%,91.15%,92.12% for identifying fake face image.

## Configuration 
Language: Python   
Library: OpenCV    
Platform: Tensorflow     
Dataset: CASIA-FASD
